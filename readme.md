1. Takes in a URL and display a shorten version of URL.
2. For the same input URL, the same shorten version of URL will be return.
3. Accessing "http://localhost:5000/<shorten_url>" will direct to "https://<corresponding url>" if there is an entry. Else, return to a page that says "URL Not Found"

Plan to use heroku (https://my-url-shortener13.herokuapp.com) for deployment but fails due to outdated python version (3.8.14) while Heroku22 requires 3.10.14.
